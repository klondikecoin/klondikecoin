What is Klondikecoin?
----------------

Klondike Coin is a modified version of Litecoin 0.8.6, which uses scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
The purpose of the Klondike coin is to emulate the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896. (More information on Klondike Gold Rush can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush).


For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Klondikecoin client sofware, see http://www.klondikecoin.com.
